# About
Once upon a time, I wanted to learn Java.  You see, as a fan of the popular
game 'Minecraft', I thought that someday I would be a sick elite modder.
That has not happened for me yet.  Turns out programming is pretty hard.
On the other hand, I do still write programs, so I got that going for me.

# Help.java
Java help system (beginners guide project)
This is a project to help me learn java from the Oracle Beginners guide.
